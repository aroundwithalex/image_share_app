# Image Share App

This project is in fulfilment of a technical test set by Hedgehog
labs. It contains the basic structure of an image sharing app.

# How to run

There are a couple of ways of running the project. The first is to
just run the test suite via `pytest -v` or `uv run pytest -v`. You'll
need to install the requirements in the uv.lock file first.

# Additional areas of work

- Add machine learning models for image classification and captions
with scikit-learn.
- Add CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
